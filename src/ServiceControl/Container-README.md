## Usage

The following is the most basic way to create ServiceControl containers using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), assuming a RabbitMQ message broker also hosted in a Docker container using default `guest`/`guest` credentials:

```shell
docker run -d --name servicecontrol -p 33333:33333 \
    -e TRANSPORTTYPE=RabbitMQ.QuorumConventionalRouting \
    -e CONNECTIONSTRING="host=rabbitmq" \
    -e RAVENDB_CONNECTIONSTRING="http://servicecontrol-db:8080" \
    -e REMOTEINSTANCES='[{"api_uri":"http://audit:44444/api"}]' \
    particular/servicecontrol:latest --setup-and-run
```

For all other usage information see the [official container documentation](https://docs.particular.net/servicecontrol/servicecontrol-instances/deployment/containers).

## Image tagging

### `latest` tag

This tag is primarily for developers wanting to use the latest version. If a release targets the current latest major or is a new major after the previous latest, then the `:latest` tag is applied to the image pushed to Docker Hub.

If the release is a patch release to a previous major, then the `:latest` tag will not be added.

### Version tags

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. Release images pushed to Docker Hub will be tagged with the release version.

### Major version tag

The latest release within a major version will be tagged with the major version number only on images pushed to Docker Hub. This allows users to target a specific major version to help avoid the risk of incurring breaking changes between major versions.

### Minor version tag

The latest release within a minor version will be tagged with `{major}.{minor}` on images pushed to Docker Hub. This allows users to target the latest patch within a specific minor version.

## Image architecture

This image is a multi-arch image based on the [`mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0-jammy-chiseled-composite`](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dotnet/aspnet/about) base image supporting `linux/arm64` and `linux/amd64`.
