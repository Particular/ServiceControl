# This script is used during CI to download a self-contained RavenDB server version to deploy/RavenDBServer
# so that it can be packaged with the ServiceControl installer.
#
# This is not necessary during local development, as the developer likely has the most recent version of
# .NET and ASP.NET runtimes installed and can use them to run RavenDB.Embedded
#
# The ServiceControl.Persistence.RavenDB project is responsible for turning the RavenDBServer into an
# artifact during development, but has a condition to skip that step on a CI server so that the
# self-contained version is used instead.
